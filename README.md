# Speech Processing with Kaldi
## Tutorial on using Kaldi for Dysarthric Speech Recognition and Speaker Recognition.
### The data used is provided by the University of Toronto for free. 
- http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~complingweb/data/TORGO/torgo.html
- Speakers have speech impairments due to **Cerebral Palsy** or **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**.

### Goals of this excercise 
1. Build a kaldi-based GMM-HMM acoustic model for speech recognition.
2. Improve the recognition accuracy for impaired speech (data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, etc.) 
3. Train a DNN-HMM acoustic model using the alignments from the GMM-HMM model. 
4. Perform speaker identification/recognition via i-vectors and improve baseline results.
